<h2 id="prototypes-prototypes-and-more-prototypes">Prototypes, prototypes and more prototypes</h2>

<p>Last week at the Department we’ve been brainstorming some concepts about how to improve the quality and frequency of reporting by other government departments</p>

<p>While we are still yet to gain access to any actual users of our systems we have begun creating <strong>paper prototypes</strong> of potential solutions and showing them to users with a similar perspective and members of the general public</p>

<p>Below we will detail all of the designs, both epic-survivor and fail-whale to discuss some of there pros and cons. The opinions and ideas expressed below are a mix of all the above mentioned stakeholders liberally mixed with my own biases and forgetfulness.</p>

<p>You can click on the icons below to see the full sized images and leave a comment below if any catch your fancy (or make you ill)</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto01---autofilljpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto01---autofilljpg-01---autofill-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_01 - autofill.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_01 - autofill.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #01 - Autofill prototype</h3>

<p>The simple idea of using DTF and other public data to auto populate fields in the form</p>

<p>This prototype provoked the best stakeholder comment of the day… “Isn’t this what you’re doing?”</p>

<p>While this is a fairly common form technique and one we are assuming we will use, we still wanted to put it in front of our users and get feedback on exceptions to the rule or any little caveats they may think might apply to this form</p>

<p>In particular we were warned to <strong>be careful</strong> with geographic boundaries of <strong>municipalities</strong> and <strong>post-codes</strong></p>

<p>There are also cases where we want to <strong>encourage thinking</strong> and <strong>observing</strong> over just getting it done quick. In some of these cases we may want to consider not autofilling some fields even if we can</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto02---last-responsejpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto02---last-responsejpg-02---lastfill-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_02 - last response.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_02 - last response.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #02 - Lastfill prototype</h3>

<p>This concept fills in the form with the last used answers in a distinct color, fields can be updated or left with the defaults</p>

<p>Although the prototype was rejected as it might encourage less thinking about responses, there were some insights gleaned in any case</p>

<p>Firstly was a feature we’d not considered, an <strong>audit trail</strong></p>

<p>Additionally there may be some cases where <strong>highlighting</strong> (or <strong>red flagging</strong>) variations or changes to the status of a project</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto03---saved-fieldsjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto03---saved-fieldsjpg-03---saved-fields-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_03 - saved fields.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_03 - saved fields.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #03 - Saved fields prototype</h3>

<p>This concept is to save the most commonly used options in a drop down or combo list</p>

<p>Might be handy for some fields, but is also likely to promote no-thinking submissions, probably a <strong>no no</strong> in most situations</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto04---feedbackjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto04---feedbackjpg-04---fast-feedback-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_04 - feedback.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_04 - feedback.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #04 - Fast feedback prototype</h3>

<p>This concept alerts users to issues in the form and prompts the DTF for prompt action</p>

<p>The confirmation of completion model was very well received although the DTF will not be contacting any departments without an explicit request</p>

<p><strong>Red flagging</strong> incomplete fields would also be a good feature</p>

<p><strong>Validation of form data</strong> like the current excel trials could also be a good feature</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto05---savingjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto05---savingjpg-05---saved-progress-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_05 - saving.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_05 - saving.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #05 - Saved progress prototype</h3>

<p>The idea of saving (maybe with login or maybe on local storage) a form in a half completed state</p>

<p>Saving progress is a <strong>must have</strong> as the form may take some time to complete</p>

<p>Simple <strong>background saving</strong> would be the best mode and the ability to <strong>export to pdf</strong> would also be appreciated</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto06---multidimentionaljpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto06---multidimentionaljpg-06---multidementional-input-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_06 - multidimentional.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_06 - multidimentional.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #06 - Multidementional input prototype</h3>

<p>Allow for a more fluid or human feel by replacing radio buttons with two dimentional graphs</p>

<p>Multidimensional inputs were thoroughly derided (thankfully) as were <strong>any</strong> other <strong>attempts to fuzzify scoring</strong> away from integers</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto07---examplesjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto07---examplesjpg-07---examples-included-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_07 - examples.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_07 - examples.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #07 - Examples included prototype</h3>

<p>This concept includes examples of what would constitute a score of a certain value in each field</p>

<p>The idea of including examples for users to refer to was also <strong>discouraged</strong> as the DTF do not want to be seen to be dictating how departments score contractors</p>

<p>This kind of implies that getting standardized scoring could be <strong>problematic</strong> or at least <strong>difficult</strong></p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto08---workflowjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto08---workflowjpg-08---workflow-management-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_08 - workflow.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_08 - workflow.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #08 - Workflow management prototype</h3>

<p>This form has a backend to monitor the progress and dates of a contract and allert key people at the right moment or automate preprepared automated tasks</p>

<p>Feedback suggests this would be useful in conjunction with <strong>reminders to kick start the process</strong> after a waiting period</p>

<p>Looks good and is <strong>worth showing</strong> to the departments for further feedback</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto09---importjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto09---importjpg-09---importing-data-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_09 - import.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_09 - import.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #09 - Importing data prototype</h3>

<p>This concept coould import much of the required data from a departments own CMS/otherMS/database/spreadsheets</p>

<p>We were warned that departments might <strong>not</strong> have systems <strong>sophisticated enough</strong> to export reports from, or those reports might contain insufficient data</p>

<p>Any <strong>changes discovered</strong> in static data should be <strong>flagged</strong> and investigated</p>

<p>It is also <strong>unlikely</strong> that the departments would be <strong>wiling to share</strong> internal reports</p>

<p>Additionally the issue of <strong>who is going to pay</strong> for all this came up during this prototype (although the question holds for any solution and is a factor we have so far only considered in passing)</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto10---segmentedjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto10---segmentedjpg-10---segmented-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_10 - segmented.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_10 - segmented.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #10 - Segmented prototype</h3>

<p>This is a build your own <strike>adventure</strike> reporting form meta-form</p>

<p>Some employees will <strong>not like the idea</strong> of building their own forms</p>

<p>Besides, all fields are <strong>mandatory</strong> … maybe this is why no one gives much feedback now?</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto11---educationjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto11---educationjpg-11---educational-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_11 - education.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_11 - education.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #11 - Educational prototype</h3>

<p>This prototype would include guidelines and educational material on how to assess the quality and performance of a construction project</p>

<p>An <strong>expand/collapse all</strong> toggle would be essential, along with <strong>back to top</strong> markers</p>

<p>Otherwise this one is a <strong>good idea</strong> as long as it’s not done with hover tips</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto12---freeformjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto12---freeformjpg-12---freeform-reporting-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_12 - freeform.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_12 - freeform.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #12 - Freeform reporting prototype</h3>

<p>This was a fun concept that came out of a group brainstorming session, just a field for the contract number and a whole world of opportunities</p>

<p>Hell no! was approximately the feedback this prototype received… but if time allowed this just might grant significant insight into the issues, and wouldn’t you just love to see what came back</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto13---spreadsheetjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto13---spreadsheetjpg-13---spreadsheet-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_13 - spreadsheet.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_13 - spreadsheet.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #13 - Spreadsheet prototype</h3>

<p>This concept was to make people comfortable with spreadsheets feel right at home, the extra cells could be used for intermediate calculations with the locations of the final values the only predefined locations, this way the departments could build their own forms in a compatible way</p>

<p>Not very well received, but might still be an interesting final touch</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto14---journeyjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto14---journeyjpg-14---journey-mapping-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_14 - journey.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_14 - journey.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #14 - Journey mapping prototype</h3>

<p>This prototype allows a user to order the form as they wish and then provides visual indicators of progress and breadcrumbs for backtracking or skipping ahead</p>

<p>This design was very <strong>well received</strong> by our test audience</p>

<p><strong>Autosaving</strong> is a must</p>

<p>Sections must not be able to be skipped</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto15---delegationjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto15---delegationjpg-15---delegation-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_15 - delegation.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_15 - delegation.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #15 - Delegation prototype</h3>

<p>This met-form concept makes it easy to delegate sub-components to any person or group, allowing for a collabrotive final report</p>

<p>Usually this is performed by one person, but this would be <strong>great for two or more</strong></p>

<p>Education department in particular <strong>might be interested</strong></p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality concerns</strong> for segments that might be sent out to external entities</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto16---remindersjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto16---remindersjpg-16---reminders-and-alerts-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_16 - reminders.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_16 - reminders.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #16 - Reminders and alerts prototype</h3>

<p>This concept is just for a system to monitor public contracting information and prompt departments that reporting on a contract is (over?) due</p>

<p>Reminders would be <strong>very worthwhile</strong>, and <strong>detailing the reason</strong> for the update/review would also be great</p>

<p>Worth discussing with Housing and other <strong>departments</strong></p>

<p>Some people would have <strong>too many reports</strong> and a <strong>summary</strong> or <strong>digest</strong> might be more appropriate</p>

<p><strong>Include links</strong> to forms and resources</p>

<p>More <strong>time for departments to plan</strong> for reporting rather than reacting after the fact would be a great thing</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto17---indirectjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto17---indirectjpg-17---indirect-scoring-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_17 - indirect.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_17 - indirect.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #17 - Indirect scoring prototype</h3>

<p>This concept was to use multiple reviewers and utilise the wisdom of the crouds to use something like the mean values on the final report</p>

<p>Not well received as it involves <strong>duplication of effort</strong></p>

<p>However <strong>time based aggregation</strong> might be useful for displaying <strong>sensitive information</strong> to the public</p>

<p>Another idea might be to <strong>aggregate different classes</strong> of reporting (such as department/contractor/public)</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto18---analyticsjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto18---analyticsjpg-18---analytics-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_18 - analytics.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_18 - analytics.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #18 - Analytics prototype</h3>

<p>This concept was just to display a publicly visible dashboard of Victorian procurement reporting, allowing the public visibility so that they can exert pressure on departments to improve reporting to DTF</p>

<p><strong>Reporting to departments</strong> on their reporting (gamification of the reporting process). Dep v Dep <strong>leaderboards</strong>. Allow contractors to <strong>report on departments</strong> too (allows them to exert pressure on departments to report better)</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto19---flavoursjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto19---flavoursjpg-19---input-flavours-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_19 - flavours.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_19 - flavours.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #19 - Input flavours prototype</h3>

<p>This idea allows users to flip between different styles of input for ratings for example from radio boxes, sliders, numeric text or some other method</p>

<p>Fuzzy inputs might not help anything. Might lead to <strong>inconsistent</strong> scoring</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto20---gamificationjpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto20---gamificationjpg-20---gamification-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_20 - gamification.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_20 - gamification.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #20 - Gamification prototype</h3>

<p>This concept was to increase engagement by rewarding participation with points and harnessing the competitive nature of people by creating some kind of leaderboard of reported data</p>

<p>Positive feedback on <strong>both</strong> aspects</p>

<p>Feedback also indicated a <strong>work-to-go</strong> meter might be more pleasant than a work-done meter</p>

<h3 id="dtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto21---independancejpg-height120px-width120pxdtf-blogimagesprotosdtfproto21---independancejpg-21---data-independence-prototype"><a href="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_21 - independance.jpg"><img src="/DTF-Blog/images/protos/DTF_Proto_21 - independance.jpg" alt="" height="120px" width="120px" /></a> #21 - Data independence prototype</h3>

<p>This concept allows departments to host there own solutions under the condition they provide an API to allow DTF to access the data it requires to evaluate performance on a contract</p>

<p>This could take the form of a simple API specification or an “out of the box” prerolled solution (something like a python server, postgresBD &amp; custom DTF UI on a thumb-drive ready to rock a web-API)</p>

<p>Review specific data will still need to be <strong>kept somewhere</strong></p>

<p>Usually data is <strong>locked up</strong> in a CMS system</p>

<p>We could use a <strong>shadow database</strong> into which we dump the public aspects, then we can expose that without risk</p>

<p>Auditability and <strong>traceability of data</strong> then becomes an issue</p>

<p>Requires <strong>work</strong> to make data available, but would be very <strong>valuable</strong></p>

<h2 id="well-thats-all-for-now-kiddo">Well, thats all for now kiddo</h2>

<p>Well that the roundup of our current prototypes, hopefully we’ll have a few digitized versions for you to click on soon enough</p>

<p>In the mean time feel free to send any <b>C</b>omments, <b>C</b>orrections, <b>C</b>oncerns, <b>C</b>omplaints or anything else beginning with the letter <strong>“C”</strong> to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#050;&#048;&#049;&#054;&#045;&#100;&#116;&#102;&#045;&#102;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#119;&#115;&#104;&#105;&#112;&#064;&#099;&#111;&#100;&#101;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#097;&#117;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#097;&#108;&#105;&#097;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">DTF Project Feedback</a>… that is if you don’t feel like leaving a comment in our spiffy new comments section below telling us which ones you love and/or hate :D</p>
